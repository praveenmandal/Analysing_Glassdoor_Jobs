Why this job?

1. Work on a product people love that solves real problems: Your friends and family can use Notion to take notes, display photos, collect recipes — while Fortune 500 companies use it to run huge teams (and some non-profits use it to conserve wildlife).
2. Help define what data means at Notion: As the first hire working full-time on data at Notion, you'll have outsized influence on what data infrastructure, data analysis, and data team structure look like as we grow the business.
3. Join us at a magical time: We've hit profitability and product-market fit, which gives us a huge green field to work with. You'd join at the perfect time to shape what we build and how we grow.
So, what will you do as a Data Scientist at Notion?
You'll build models to predict things like conversion and likelihood of churn.
You'll build and maintain KPI dashboards that teams rely on for making key decisions.
You'll collaborate with team leads across the business to understand and support their data needs.
You'll build and improve our underlying data infrastructure and tooling. (We currently use DBT, Snowflake, Mode Analytics, Fivetran, Census, Amplitude, Segment, and more).

Life @ Scoop

Founded in 2015 and based in downtown SF, our team mixes technology and elbow grease every day, with one statistic in our crosshairs: 80% of Americans drive alone to work. At Scoop, we envision a world where commuters feel empowered — starting with a choice to make their commute a meaningful part of their day. We embody that same spirit within our own culture, empowering every team member to make this the most meaningful experience of their career.

Walk into Scoop and you’ll find a furry, tail-wagging welcoming committee. In many ways these fluffy faces exemplify the energy that flows through our office. They are a reminder that while we’re focused and driven, we shouldn’t take ourselves too seriously. They also help bridge the gap between our homes and our workplace, just like a Scoop carpool.

The atmosphere overall is dynamic and unique. It’s influenced by our backgrounds at successful startups, big tech companies, and premier consulting firms — blended and crafted into what feels natural and right for this company. It plays out in our balance of scrappy and strategic, frameworks and fast thinking.

At Scoop, we’re all united by our desire to change the way people get to work — and committed to enjoying the journey together along the way.",Scoop," CA",Company - Private,Internet,Information Technology,131965,161310,2020-04-25,2020-06-05,131965,161310

We have a laid-back, friendly office culture. Over lunch you'll often find us discussing the latest in technology, books, and pop culture, and then maybe getting in a quick game of chess or babyfoot (foosball).
Since we're an early-stage company, we move fast, and it's important that each member of our team is able to take ownership of projects by defining problems, brainstorming solutions, and running experiments.",Triplebyte," NY",Company - Private,Computer Hardware & Software,Information Technology,145000,225000,2020-04-28,2020-06-05,145000,225000
